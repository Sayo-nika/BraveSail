TO USE THIS PACK YOU MUST *CLEARLY* CREDIT THE SPRITE AND CHARACTER TO YAGAMIRAI10 SOMEWHERE IN YOUR MOD'S CREDITS.

Commercial use of any kind is forbidden. Any project using this sprite must follow the Team Salvato IP guidelines, including that it may only be used in mods that are patched into DDLC rather than standalone games.

NSFW/lewd is forbidden without specific permission. Contact me on Reddit (yagamirai10) or Discord (yagamirai10#7046) to ask me.

Usage of the sprite and character in any work containing hate speech or inciting/encouraging hate against a group of people is forbidden.

Making other poses/expressions/outfits is allowed and encouraged, but you must clearly credit me for the original and share your edits freely.

Using parts from Mio's sprites for edits is also allowed under the same terms. (If you want to use her parts for an original character whose sprites you don't want to share, please contact me for permission.)

Please keep her character more or less intact and keep the name "Mio". Changing her personality to some extent is fine (and I purposely kept the details vague), particularly if you're doing a meme mod or something where you change everything, but don't use the sprites for a different character. Using edits for OCs is fine, just please make it look like a different character, don't just change the hair color.
