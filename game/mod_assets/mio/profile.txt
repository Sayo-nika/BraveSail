Mio is an 18 year old third year student. While somewhat reserved, it's not out of shyness - she's just quite proper and ladylike. She tends to be a "mom friend" and frets about people around her. Before joining the Literature Club (or if she's not in the Literature Club) she was a member of her school's go club and is quite skilled at the game. (Competition being the one thing that brings out her less-than-ladylike side.)

Her favorite books are classic Japanese literature, and she writes haiku. (Or otherwise short but evocative poems.)
Her words tend to relate to nature, Japanese culture, and "classy"/traditional things.
